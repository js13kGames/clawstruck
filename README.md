## About The Game
Clawstruck is a fast-paced arcade game where your goal is to survive as long as possible by dodging the relentless attacks of a mischievous cat's paw. Test your reflexes as the attacks get faster and more unpredictable over time.



## How to Play
Use the `Arrow Keys` or `W, A, S, D` to move your character around the grid and avoid the incoming paw strikes.
